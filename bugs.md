Hello!

My name is Cayleigh! I'm the one that worked on this website. If you see this, you are probably deep diving into the code! Welcome!

This is where I vent, journal and write out any bugs that I expereinced while creating this project.

If you read this and you do not code, that is okay. This is my journal meant to show my thought process while working through coding problems.

Writing things down helps me think clearly. It also helps me remember what I did. When I have a problem, writing can help me see it in a new way.

I believe everyone can and should try to write in a journal. We all think in different ways. Writing can help us understand things better. It also feels good to see how much progress we make. 


Feel free to read on, but do not worry if it is confusing! My brain can be confusing even for me. 


Happy reading!

My record: 

okay, I wanted to do this project as a thank you for your support the last few months, it's been greatly appreciated. Also as a thank you for creating my yotube banner. It's a little bit because I feel bad he's not gettign hsi credit for fixing up the banner in a way that looks nice, but also because I need more projects to try. I like creating websites for people, especially those that I have a good realtionship with, so I'm doing this as a practice especially since it's a more simple form of a website. 


My plan for now:

Make a business card that flips on load time (for any non coders, when you open or refresh a page).  

I also thought about helping him create a resume andthen having a downloadable pdf version that anyone can use. 

I dont know what colors to use just yet (I should hav ethought this through before starting, but I like to start by setting up the files and doing some basic codes.)

I want to practice this for mobile view first. So that's going to be my goal. I love interactive websites so I think when you click on the business card (in the corner where I will put a round dot or something with an arrow that says "click me!") then when you click that it also spins/flips very fast.

For colros I'm thinking:

green
soft orange?
white
black (for text and background features)

I will also be open to feedback from fernando, but as of right now he  dosen't know I'm making this.
